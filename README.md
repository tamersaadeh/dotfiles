# Tamer's dotfiles

## dotfiles

I have based my dotfiles on scripts by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). However, most of the scripts and dot files have been rewritten from scratch or slightly modified because I use bash and MacPorts instead of zsh and homebrew, respectively.

## install

Run this:

```
sh
git clone https://github.com/tamersaadeh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## TODO

* Add the rest of the bash scripts
* OSX/Linux specifics
* Android SDK/NDK install
* Macports scripts
* Development tools
* Backup and restore scripts

## thanks

I forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s great [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), which is originally on [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb)' [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). Most of the code is inspired by the "topical" approach that Holman uses.
