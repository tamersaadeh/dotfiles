# Tamer's dotfiles

## dotfiles

I have reused some of the scripts and dot files create by [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles). The main differences are that I use bash as my main shell instead of zsh and macport instead of homebrew so many files have been dropped to replace both.

## install

Run this:

```
sh
git clone https://github.com/tamersaadeh/dotfiles.git ~/.dotfiles
cd ~/.dotfiles
script/bootstrap
```

## thanks

I forked [Zach Holman](https://github.com/holman)'s great [dotfiles](https://github.com/holman/dotfiles), which is originally on [Ryan Bates](https://github.com/ryanb)' [dotfiles](https://github.com/ryanb/dotfiles). Most of the code is inspired by the "topical" approach that Holman uses.
